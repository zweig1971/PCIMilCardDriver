General
=~=~=~=
This package consists of the following three components:

 - The device driver (avpcl32)
   files: avpcldrv.h
          avpcldrv.c
          params.h
          avpcl.h
          funcs.h
 - A shared library  (libavpcl32)
   files: pci_lib_linux.h
          pci_lib_linux.c
          funcs.c
          avpcl.h
          avpcl.c
          avpcldrv.h
 - A demo program    (PclTest)
   files: PclTest.c
          avpcl.h

Requirements
=~=~=~=~=~=~=
  This driver is designed to work on a system with kernel
  2.6 or later.
  
  You need to have the kernel sources installed to compile the
  driver. If that is the case, you can most likely find them
  in /usr/src/linux/, where 'linux' is a symbolic link to a
  directory named something like linux-2.6.8-24.

Quick Guide
=~=~=~=~=~=
(1) Extract files from archive and change to the correct directory
  unzip avpci3xx.zip
  cd Linux

(1a) set mode for starting script
  chmod +x avpcl 
  
(2) Compile Driver
  make
  
(3) Compile Library
  make library

(4) Become root and install Library
  su
  cp libavpcl32.so.3.36 /usr/lib
  ldconfig
  ln -s /usr/lib/libavpcl32.so.3 /usr/lib/libavpcl32.so

(5) Start the Driver (root priviledge needed!)
  ./avpcl start

(6) Leave root account
  exit

(7) Compile the demo program
  make PclTest
  
(8) Start the demo program
  ./PclTest 0x1001

(9) Look at the demo program and avpcl.h to create
    your own application that uses the driver and library


What about ...
=~=~=~=~=~=~=~=

...the driver?
  Be sure that your system meets the requirements to compile the driver.
  Running 'make' will start compiling the driver.
  You can run the driver using the provided shell script (avpcl). Please have
  a look at it before running it to ensure that it fits to your
  special system. To run the driver automatically, you should consult
  the documentation of your version of linux.

...the devicefiles?
  The 'avpcl' start script creates 10 device files in /dev. They have names from
  'avpcl0' to 'avpcl9' and are used to access PCL cards 1 to 10 (if you are using
  more than one card).
  If you want to change the location to something other than /dev, you have to
  change the concerning compileroption (PATHTODEVICEFILES) in the Makefile
  (see target 'library') and the variable at the beginning of 'avpcl' start script.
  For the current directory, use './'.

...the library?
  The library file which is generated by 'make library' is named something like
  libavpcl32.so.0.1. If you don't want to copy it to /usr/lib (or if you are
  not able to do so), you can use any other location as well. Be aware that the
  library can be found when compiling or starting an application that uses it.

...the demo program?
  The demo program shows how to develop applications that make use of the
  driver and library. It needs the curses library to be compiled and run.
  This program is useful to see how the library and driver are working and
  how to develop software based on the driver.
